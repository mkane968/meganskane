                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the English Department at Seton Hall University, where I teach writing and research how emerging technologies, including AI, are shaping and complicating writing pedagogy.</p>
                    <p>AI has become a particular focus of my work given how quickly it is entering writing classrooms. I have developed the AI Aware Writing Environment, a platform that allows instructors to set clear parameters around AI use while providing students with structured opportunities to receive AI-generated feedback. I am currently piloting this platform in writing courses and welcome more users; visit <a href="https://www.aawe.ai/" target="_blank">www.aawe.ai</a> for more information.</p>
                    <p>I also study how students engage with sources (both traditional and AI generated) in their writing. This research started with my dissertation, where I created and validated a codebook for analyzing how first-year students use citations rhetorically. I have since turned that work into <a href="https://github.com/mkane968/citation-analysis-tool" target="_blank">Source Mapper</a>, a machine learning application that can analyze citation practices at scale and reveal how writers position themselves within academic conversations.</p>
                    <p>In addition to my teaching and research, I am a recipient of the 2025-2026 <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/about/fellowships/" target="_blank">WAC Clearinghouse Associate Publishers New Scholar Fellowship</a>, a 12-month editorial position that involves serving as Assistant Editor for the Journal of Writing Analytics and collaborating with researchers to launch the WAC Clearinghouse Collection of Writing Corpora.</p>
                    <p>I teach first-year writing, literature, and grammar at Seton Hall, and I work as a faculty tutor in the Writing Center. I earned my PhD in English from Temple University and my BA in English Education from Elizabethtown College.</p>
                    <p>Check out more about this work and my upcoming projects below. Feel free to reach out if you would like a copy of my CV.</p>

                    <h3>AI Aware Writing Environment (AAWE)</h3>
                    <p>AI Aware Writing Environment (AAWE) is a web application that addresses the challenges of integrating generative AI into writing instruction. Using AAWE, instructors can develop writing assignments with customizable parameters that define exactly what kind of AI support is appropriate for each assignment, from complete restriction to targeted grammar assistance to advanced feedback aligned with specific prompts.</p>
                    <p>Students then work within these defined parameters, receiving AI-generated feedback that is tailored to the instructor's assignment goals and pedagogical objectives. The platform also features a proprietary probability scoring system that combines linguistic analysis with process-based features to help instructors identify potential AI misuse.</p>
                    <p>The project has received significant funding from competitions hosted by Temple University's Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and it has been piloted in my own classroom. Preliminary findings have been presented at the 2025 Conference on College Composition and Communication and DH 2025 in Lisbon.</p>
                    <p>In Fall 2025, I am leading an IRB-approved study with Seton Hall instructors piloting AAWE in their courses. Instructors interested in using AAWE can check out my website for more information.</p>

                    <h3>SourceMapper Citation Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Source Mapper is a web application that analyzes how writers use citations rhetorically in academic texts. Built on a rhetorical codebook I developed and validated as part of my dissertation research, the tool detects citation styles (APA, MLA, Chicago) and classifies the rhetorical moves authors make when citing sources.</p>
                    <p>SourceMapper identifies key rhetorical "moves" students take when citing sources, including reporting factual content, synthesizing ideas, evaluating source credibility, and questioning significance. These classifications reveal how writers position themselves within scholarly conversations and engage with their sources beyond simple attribution. Results appear through a color-coded interface, with sample texts available for exploration.</p>
                    <p>I have used Source Mapper to analyze disciplinary differences in citation practices across the MICUSP corpus, and findings will be published in an upcoming volume of the Journal of Writing Analytics. The project demonstrates how computational tools can illuminate the nuanced ways writers construct academic authority through source integration.</p>

                    <h3>The SF Nexus</h3>
                    <p>The SF Nexus is a collaborative project dedicated to digitizing new wave science fiction texts and enabling digital research. As part of the research team from 2022-2023, I contributed to building an open-access platform that provides researchers with valuable resources including extracted feature sets from copyrighted literature, custom Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, and comprehensive documentation of our digitization and analysis pipelines. The project makes these resources freely available to support computational analysis of science fiction literature.</p>
                    <div class="project-image">
                        <img src="images/LDA_topic_modeling.png" alt="LDA Topic Modeling visualization for SF Nexus" class="project-screenshot">
                    </div>
                    <p>My contributions focused on developing and implementing the computational pipeline for analyzing over 400 science fiction texts. A key task was creating structured "extracted feature" datasets that comply with copyright law while enabling computational analysis. These datasets include disaggregated text representations, word frequency counts, and semantic descriptors, available at different text segmentation levels (full texts, chapters, and 1000-word chunks).</p>
                    <p>Building on this foundation, I designed and optimized topic modeling workflows using Python's Gensim and BERTopic libraries. This dual approach, combining extracted features with topic modeling, helps map the evolution of science fiction themes across different time periods and subgenres.</p>
                    <p>The project's visualizations allow researchers to explore how themes like artificial intelligence, space exploration, and dystopian futures have evolved in new wave science fiction. This approach provides robust quantitative methods for tracking genre evolution and identifying connections between works while respecting copyright constraints.</p>
